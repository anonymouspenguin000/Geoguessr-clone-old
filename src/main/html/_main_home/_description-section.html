        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    <p class="paragraph paragraph--center description-section__text">
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

        This is a very exciting geography game. At the start, it puts
        the player in a random location of Google Street View (a service
        of panoramic  photos). The player can "walk" around the
        location to see more references. The main goal is to guess where
        the player was placed: exact continent, exact country, state,
        city/town, etc...
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--center description-section__text">
        You have been given a 2D-map, that you can move/zoom. You have
        to mark your guess and click "Guess". You will be shown the
        actual location, guess accuracy and other details.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--center description-section__text">
        You don't have to spend hours and hours looking for the right
        answer. It takes about 2 minutes: start, look for a couple of
        references, mark your guess and click "Guess". That's all!
        Many players do this way. But it's not very interesting and
        doesn't make much progress. You can dive deeper and spend
        lots of time to find lots of references and guess much more
        accurate. I think it's wonderful!
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--center description-section__text">
        But nobody forbids you to go professional way, like me. You
        can use the Internet. Yes, you can: translate foreign texts,
        look for the streets and shops that you see, use sandboxes,
        etc. In short, you can do everything with this game. It's
        the most interesting way playing this game.

    <p class="paragraph paragraph--center description-section__text">
        The "couple-minute" method will give you much more points,
        than you would get if you try the "deep" method. But the second
        method is much more interesting. It's your choice: more points,
        but not interesting, or fewer points, but more interesting.
        Yes, points also depend on time. Shown below in the Tutorial.

    <p class="paragraph paragraph--center description-section__text">
        You can do everything with this game, except "hacking". All
        the data (including the game) is loaded into your browser's
        cache and storage, so you can replace some sources, call a
        "winning" function to automatically win the game, use the
        built-in devtools to see the current location, etc. It's
        not even called "hacking", but "cheating". Game-cheating
        is not against the law, but it's not fair. Nobody forbids
        doing this, but it's not interesting. So do anything,
        except hacking. If you really want to hack the game -
        do it only for education/experience in programming. If
        you want to enjoy the gameplay - do it without hacking.
        But don't forget: real hacking is against the law (when
        you harm other users, break the service, etc.).
