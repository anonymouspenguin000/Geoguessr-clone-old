    So, here we go. If you want, you can set your preferences before entering the
    game. In the first field, you specify the region you want to discover. Choose
    what you want: the whole world (an absolutely random location), or a continent
    you like (a random location exactly on this continent). Then you can see the
    "Preferences" button. If you click it, you will be shown the preferences. You
    can enable/disable the compass, or the visible timer (it will not affect the
    in-game timer). The next feature - you can enable experiments. Just hold the
    "Preferences" button for 3 seconds. Here you can disable "small-screen-ban",
    for example.

  <p class="paragraph paragraph--center tutorial-section__text">
    You've set your preferences, and now you're ready to enter the game. Just press
    the "START" button. And here... I haven't found another "cheap" way to generate
    a random street view... You are given a blank map and the Pegman (the yellow-man).
    If you don't see them, just wait for them to load. You have to drag Pegman and
    drop to a random place on the blank map. Actually, the map is not blank. It
    inherits the normal behavior of Google Maps. But its center is loaded at random
    coordinates. When you drag and drop the Pegman, you're actually dropping it to
    a random panorama. You just don't see anything on the map. Therefore, you can
    miss the right place and nothing will happen. Then just try again. If nothing
    happened 2-3 times, refresh the map - click the button below. It will load
    another random location. And try the Pegman again. When you hit the right place,
    you will know about it when the window disappears. In 15 seconds you will enter
    the game. If you see the white screen - it's a bug - reload. If you see the
    black screen - wait; nothing happened - the request was denied - reload.

    Here, you're finally in the game. Let's look at the interface. In the left-top
    corner are the utilities, that you can enable/disable in the Preferences.
    In the right-top are the game stats. In the left-bottom is the game navigation:
    quit the game, go to the start of the location and zoom the panorama. In the
    right-bottom is the minimap, where you can mark your guess. You can make it
    bigger/smaller, or hide/show it - for comfort. For better accuracy - move and
    zoom. And the panorama. You can look around it by moving the mouse. If it's
    a road, you can walk by pressing the arrows on the screen. If you want to
    mark your guess - click a place on the minimap and then click the "Guess"
    button.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph paragraph--center tutorial-section__text">
    Your goal is to guess where you were placed. Exactly where you were placed at
    the start. For example, if you were placed to France, and you decided to go
    to Spain by a road, then if you mark Spain as your guess, you will miss, because
    you were placed to France and you should've marked France. Actually, at the
    start, you don't know if it's France or Spain, or some another country. But that
    was just an example.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph paragraph--center tutorial-section__text">
    At the end you are shown the results: your guess position and the real position;
    distance between them and time spent guessing; guess accuracy and points;
    formulas (if you want to know) and the link to the homepage. Guess accuracy
    depends on the distance - the closer you guess, the bigger your accuracy. Points
    depend on the accuracy and the time - the bigger your accuracy, the more points
    you get; the faster you guess - the bigger points you get. Again, the formulas
    are shown.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph paragraph--center tutorial-section__text">
    You can see your stats and history - the link or icon in the right-top corner of
    the homepage. You can pause logging history; export it to a local file, import
    or delete. Sometimes you will have to complete the "captcha".
